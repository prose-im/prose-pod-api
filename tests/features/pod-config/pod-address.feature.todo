Feature: Setting the Prose Pod address

  Background:
    Given the Prose Pod API has started
      And the server config has been initialized
      And Valerian is an admin

  Rule: Only admins can set the Prose Pod address

    Scenario Outline: Rémi (not admin) tries to set the Prose Pod address
      Given Rémi is not an admin
       When Rémi sets the Prose Pod address to <address>
       Then the HTTP status code should be Forbidden
        And the response content type should be JSON
        And the error reason should be "forbidden"

    Examples:
      | address    |
      | an IPv4    |
      | an IPv6    |
      | a hostname |

  """
  For federation.
  """
  Rule: IPv4, IPv6 or hostname is mandatory

    Scenario: IPv4
      Given Temp

    Scenario: IPv6

    it doesn't have a static IP address, but can be accessed via a given hostname.
    """
    Scenario: The Prose Pod has a dynamic IP address
