  The invitation accept and reject links look like `/invitations/(accept|reject)/{uuid}`,
  with the invide ID not directly accessible. However, to follow the HTTP standard,
  the Prose Pod API requires the full path to the invitation resource, which includes its ID.
  Therefore, the Prose Pod Dashboard needs a way to retrieve the invitation ID in order to
  make the REST API call.

  The answer should not contain sensitive information such as the invitation creator,
  creation timestamp and accept/reject tokens, as the route needs to be publicly accessible
  (the member is joining and doesn't have a JID and role yet). Since accept/reject tokens
  are never shared outside of invitation notifications, someone with a token should be allowed
  to see this basic information, as it proves they have been invited.

  In the result we can share the accept token expiration timestamp, so it can be displayed
  in the Prose Pod Dashboard if we wanted to (e.g. "This invites expires in {countdown}").
