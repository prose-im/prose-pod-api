    summary: Factory reset
    description: |
      This will erase all data on your Pod (all settings and all user data).
      Your Pod will then restart and show the initial setup process, as if it was never used before.

      As a safety measure, the route must be called twice. After a first call containing a password
      confirmation, the API will return a `202 Accepted` response containing a confirmation token.
      This token can be used in a second call, which will perform the factory reset.

      This second call will return a `205 Reset Content`, implying the administration dashboard from
      which the API call originated should be reloaded. After the factory reset (therefore after
      returning the `205`), the API will restart and return `503 Service Unavailable` until it’s
      done. A restart usually takes less than 100ms, but `Retry-After` will have a value of 1 second
      since it’s the smallest allowed value (per the specification).
