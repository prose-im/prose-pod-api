    summary: Reload static configuration
    description: |
      Reload the static API configuration without restarting the whole ProseÂ Pod (keeps connections
      alive). Useful when changing configuration while a lot of users are chatting or in calls.

      Only admins can trigger a reload, unless the API is broken; in which case anyone can do it.
