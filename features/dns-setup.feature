Feature: DNS setup instructions

  Background:
        # NOTE: Required when `pod.address.domain` is unset
    Given config "dashboard.url" is set to "https://dashboard.prose.test.org"

  Rule: Only admins can see DNS setup instructions

    Scenario: Rémi (not admin) tries to get DNS setup instructions
      Given the XMPP server has been initialized
        And Rémi is not an admin
        And config "pod.address.ipv4" is set to "0.0.0.0"
        And the Prose Pod API has started
       When Rémi requests DNS setup instructions
       Then the HTTP status code should be Forbidden
        And the response content type should be JSON
        And the error code should be "forbidden"

  """
  `SRV` records cannot point directly to IP addresses, we need to point it to a hostname.
  """
  Rule: If the Prose Pod has a static IP address, `SRV` records point to `prose.<domain>` and `prose.<domain>` points to the Prose Pod

        And federation is enabled
        And Valerian is an admin
       When Valerian requests DNS setup instructions
       Then the call should succeed

        And step 1 should contain a single A record
        And step 2 should contain a single SRV record
        And step 3 should contain a single CNAME record
        And step 4 should contain SRV and SRV records
        And A records hostnames should be prose.<domain>

        And step 4 should contain SRV and SRV records
        And AAAA records hostnames should be prose.<domain>

    Examples:
      | domain         |

    Examples:
      | domain         |

  Rule: If the Prose Pod is publicly accessible via a domain, `SRV` records point to it

        And step 2 should contain a single CNAME record
