Feature: IP connectivity checks

  Background:
    Given the XMPP server has been initialized
      And Valerian is an admin
        # NOTE: Required when `pod.address.domain` is unset
      And config "dashboard.url" is set to "https://dashboard.prose.test.org"

  Rule: SSE route sends CHECKING events first.

    Scenario: IPv4 + IPv6
      Given config "server.domain" is set to "test.org"
        And config "pod.address.ipv4" is set to "0.0.0.0"
        And config "pod.address.ipv6" is set to "::"
        And config "pod.address.domain" is unset
        And the Prose Pod API has started
        And federation is enabled
        And prose.org’s DNS zone has a A record for test.org.
        And prose.org’s DNS zone has a AAAA record for test.org.
