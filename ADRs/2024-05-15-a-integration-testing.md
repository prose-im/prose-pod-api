## Context

<!--
This section describes the forces at play, including technological, political,
social, and project local. These forces are probably in tension, and should be
called out as such. The language in this section is value-neutral. It is simply
describing facts.
-->

<TODO:Describe>

Do not test everything, this is done in unit tests (BDD)

## Decision

<!--
This section describes our response to these forces. It is stated in full
sentences, with active voice. "We will …"
-->

<TODO:Describe>

## Consequences

<!--
This section describes the resulting context, after applying the decision.
All consequences should be listed here, not just the "positive" ones.
A particular decision may have positive, negative, and neutral consequences,
but all of them affect the team and project in the future.
